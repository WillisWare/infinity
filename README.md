# Infinity
WillisWare, LLC's attempt at a procedural generation game. Based on a concept by Logan Willis and Mike Marino, this game is intended to prove concepts of hierarchical relationships, entity interaction, and primitive AI features.

## Procedural Generation
Infinity spawns an endlessly variable multiverse container and lazy-loads entities one level at a time down to the individual lifeform. Randomization ensures that no two gaming sessions will ever be identical.

## Matter
All entities within the game are treated as *matter* and inherit a basic set of properties upon which they can expand. All matter is assumed to be a parent to some other matter.

## Life
All entities representing *life* are dependent on another *matter* entity (and, in some cases, another *life* entity). These relationships have not yet been thought out.
